      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        The 2023 NBA All-Star Game was an exhibition game played on February 19,
        2023, on the 30th anniversary of the first All-Star Game held in Salt
        Lake City in 1993. It was the 72nd edition of the event.[1] The game was
        hosted by the Utah Jazz at Vivint Arena, and was televised nationally by
        TNT for the 21st consecutive year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The announcement of the site selection was made on October 23, 2019, at
        a press conference held by the NBA and the Jazz
      </p>
      <p>
        Team Giannis defeated Team LeBron 184–175. It was Team Giannis' first
        All-Star Game victory, handing Team LeBron their first loss in such
        game. Jayson Tatum scored an All-Star Game record 55 points, and was
        named All-Star Game MVP.
      </p>
      <p>
        As had been the case in previous years, the rosters for the All-Star
        Game were selected through a voting process. The fans could vote through
        the NBA website as well as through their Google account. The starters
        were chosen by the fans, media, and current NBA players. Fans made up
        50% of the vote, and NBA players and media each comprised 25% of the
        vote. The two guards and three frontcourt players who received the
        highest cumulative vote totals in each conferences were named the
        All-Star starters and two players in each conferences with the highest
        votes were named team captains. NBA head coaches voted for the reserves
        for their respective conferences, none of which could be players from
        their own team. Each coach selected two guards, three frontcourt players
        and two wild cards, with each selected player ranked in order of
        preference within each category. If a multi-position player was to be
        selected, coaches were encouraged to vote for the player at the position
        that was "most advantageous for the All-Star team", regardless of where
        the player was listed on the All-Star ballot or the position he was
        listed in box scores.
